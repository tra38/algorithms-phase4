This is part of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 4.

The goal is to recreate several basic data structures (such as FixedArrays, Linked Lists, etc.) using the Ruby language.

Sometimes, my solution does end up looking odd (such as using metaprogramming to dynamically create variables to represent index positions in an FixedArray), but the end result always seem impressive.
